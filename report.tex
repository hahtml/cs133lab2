\section*{Experimental result}
block size:\\
16:  14.86Gflops\\
32:  14.11Gflops\\
64:  16.87Gflops\\
\\
processors:\\
4: 9.78Gflops\\
8: 12.97Gflops\\
16: 16.46Gflops\\
32: 20.15Gflops\\

\section*{Data partition}
I seperate matrix A by $n/number of processes$ and use scatter to send A to each of the processes. Then I send whole matrix B to each processes with broadcast method. Therefore, each process will execute several row times a whole matix. \\
 
 
\section*{Difference between Blocked version and Non-blocked version}
Because the version of complier, there is no unblocked version for the scatter and broadcast.\\

\section*{Scalability}
np 4: 4.69\\
np 8: 8.72\\
np 16: 14.56\\
np 32: 20.32\\
I get linear speedup as the number of processors increases.\\

\section*{Comparing to OpenMP}
Although these two kinds of method are totally different, the performance between them are similar. I roughly get same improvement on these two methods. However, the method with MPI is a little bit difficult to implement.\\
